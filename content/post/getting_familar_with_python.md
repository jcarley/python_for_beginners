Now that we have python installed along with VS Code, you'll want to get familiar with your programming environment.  In general this just takes time.  But we can introduce
you to a few things.  I could write a lengthy article walking you through it, but I think this is one of those subjects best served by a video.  Below I've linked you to a video
that will show you a few things about your python environment.  You don't have to do all the steps in the video, particularly the installing of python and VS Code.  Take note
of some of the plugins and the way the author uses VS Code in conjuction with python.
